# K03: Overly Permissive RBAC

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is authorization mechanism in Kubernetes that is responsible for permissions over resources. 

# Unnecessary use of `cluster-admin`

When a subject such as a Service Account, User, or Group has access to `cluster-admin` then, they are able to perform any action on any resource within a cluster. 

This level of permission is especially dangerous when used in a **ClusterRoleBinding** - which grants full control over every resource across the entire cluster. `cluster-admin` can also be used as a **RoleBinding** which may also pose significant risk.

# Exploit

Below, example shows assignment of `cluster-admin` to default service accunt in default namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
 name: redacted-rbac
subjects:
 - kind: ServiceAccount
   name: default
   namespace: default
roleRef:
 kind: ClusterRole
 name: cluster-admin
 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
# Prevent

To reduce the risk of an attacker, analyze your configurations continuously and ensure the principle of least privilege is always enforced. Some recommendations are below:

- Reduce direct cluster access by end users when possible
- Donâ€™t use Service Account Tokens outside of the cluster
- Avoid automatically mounting the default service account token
- Audit RBAC included with installed third-party components
- Deploy centralized polices to detect and block risky RBAC permissions
- Utilize RoleBindings to limit scope of permissions to particular namespaces
- Follow the official RBAC Good Practices in the Kubernetes docs
